## What we did in the last week.

We collected a bunch of gps location data(3 days).

Built a simple 'heat map'.

We cannot get a very clearly routine of what a person does everyday because of the lack of data set

So next step is to collect as much data as we can.

And think of a way to deal with the 'heat map'.
