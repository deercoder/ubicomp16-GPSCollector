#Routine Detection
We use GPS data to build a heat map and analyze the map based on an algorithm. 
And use the daily map to build a pattern for a person and set a initial EMD value for him/her.
If the map shows that there is a big difference in EMD value we could infer that the person's routine is abnormal.
