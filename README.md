#Routine Detection
We use GPS data to build a heat map and analyze the map based on an algorithm. 
And use the daily map to build a pattern for a person and set a initial EMD value for him/her.
If the map shows that there is a big difference in EMD value we could infer that the person's routine is abnormal.

# Weekly Report
## Progress   March,28

* Build a basic framework with Ionic
  Start to use Ionic creator to build a human interaction
  Create a Ionic project named myGPS

## Progress   April,04

* Connect google map API with Ionic framework
  Using google map API in the javaScript but failed due to the platform version
  Display the google map in <div>
    
* Trying to connect ngCordova with sqlite
  Only use ngCordova to get current geolocation but cannot connect it to sqlite
  Use localstorage instead

## Progress   April,11

* Change sqlite into localstorage
  Localstorage does work well with ngCordova in any platforms
  
* Start to gather the GPS location
  Collect geolocation by using current version(ios based)
  Use a csv file to output the data
  
## Progress   April,18

* Build a heat map by using matlab based on collected data
  The heat map is so abstract and cannot display where actually are
  Think of another way to display the data in detail
  
* Try another data set (Microsoft data set)
  Bad taste in the matlab


## Progress   April,25

* Build another version heat map by using google map API
  Use Google map API to build some functions to make every point clearer than before
* Final debug and put the algorithm into use
  Get rid of some noise made by changing from the wifi mode to celluar mode
  Using a EMD value to classify the normal maps and abnormal maps
  
## Progress   April,30

* Get a result on collected data
  
* Try our best to get more data

* Build a server as soon as possible
