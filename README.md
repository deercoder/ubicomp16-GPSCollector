## What we did in the last week.

Fix the GPS collector:

1.It can automatically collect the gps location (every 5 mins);

2.Add timestamp into the localStorage

3.Change the output file from .txt to .csv


We collected a few gps location data(3 days).

Built a simple 'heat map':

1.Scale the map;

2.Use different color to mark the point's frequency.

Next step:

More and more data is needed. 

And think of a way to deal with the 'heat map'.
