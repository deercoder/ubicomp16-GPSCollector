EMD is our selected algorithm to compare images and compute distance between two images.

for details, please refer to the following papers:

@inproceedings{eldib2014behavior,
  title={Behavior analysis for aging-in-place using similarity heatmaps},
  author={Eldib, Mohamed and Bo, Nyan Bo and Deboeverie, Francis and Xie, Xingzhe and Philips, Wilfried and Aghajan, Hamid},

}


I also refer to serveral other papers when using the `pyEMD` or `matEMD` when going through the EMD libraries and using our
heatmap dataset as they reveal some details in the implementating. These part should be related withe specific folders under
`Python` or `MATLAB`.
